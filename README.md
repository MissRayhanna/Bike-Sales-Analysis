### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions such as:

- What is the average income per purchase?
- What are the customers commute distance?
- Which age bracket purchase more?

### Data Analysis

Performed data analysis using pivot tables

### Results/ Findings

The analysis results are summarised as follows:
1. Customers with high average income purchase more bikes.
2. Short distance commuters purchase more bikes compare to long distance commuters.
3. Customers in the middle age bracket purchase more bikes hereby generating more sales.

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis done, the following actions are recommended:
- Invest in marketing and promotions during peak sales seasons. 
- Implement a marketing strategy to focus more on customers with bachelors degree in the 3 regions to maximize revenue.

### Limitations

I had to replace all the '10+ miles' with 'more than 10 miles' in the Commute distance column because they would have affected the accuracy of my conclusions from the analysis. Also had to add the 'Age bracket' column to further group the ages so as to have a clear insight on the dataset.
